  <title>Better Motherfucking Website</title>
</head>


<body>
  <header>
    <h1>This is the <em>best</em> motherfucking website.</h1>
    <p>Really, it is.</p>
  </header>
  <div>
    <h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>
    <p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB
      <span class="wr1">motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is
      going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is
      gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>
    <p><strong class="wr2">WRONG</strong>, motherfucker.</p>
    <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
    <p>Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past
      <span class="wr1">motherfuckingwebsites</span>:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
      <li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href='https://google.com'>Google home page</a></li>
      <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
      <li>Looks <em>almost</em> the same on every screen</li>
      <li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem well, <small>kind of</small></li>
      <li>It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it <small>but not
          everyone
          can
          read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</small></li>
      <li>Shit is <em>even more</em> legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style
        without
        looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> website</li>
      <li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a></li>
      <li>Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans" <small>which btw weighs
          15.21kB,
          wtf</small></li>
      <li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any
        other framework. This website is made with plain HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
      <li>Doesn't include any tracking service <small>this website does, but hey, who cares</small></li>
      <li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available JUST USE IT.</li>
      <li>Use <em>some</em> fucking <span class="colored" id="rbw">colors</span>.</li>
      <li>Links don't really need to keep that <span class="sb">shitty blue</span> the browser is giving them: nor that
        <span class="sv">violetish
          color</span> when
        they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa">nice color</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
    <p>This website is even better than the last <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy</a> and the <a
        href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy before him</a>.</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>It's over a secure connection - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different for
        everyone, pshht!).</li>
      <li>It uses one of the most general gTLDs available out there: .website</li>
      <li>It uses the TLD, too: bestmotherfucking.website, check out domainr to do something cool too.</li>
      <li>It uses the kickass Let's Encrypt CA (don't you see the gorgeous lock?)</li>
      <li>It runs on nginx: the best fucking web server instead of Apache Server</li>
      <li>It uses a custom version of the awesome ultra-lightweight jQuery /s</li>
      <li>It doesn't use a single media query well, not really</li>
      <li>t probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is outdated
        he will notice and maybe he will switch from the crap he uses to a much cooler browser</li>
      <li>It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript JavaScript logo, CSS3 CSS3 logo and HTML5 HTML5 Logo</li>
      <li>It supports HTTP/2</li>
      <li>It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious bandwidth if you visit the website more
        than once</li>
      <li>It uses Piwik, a free and Open Source analytics platform (we still love you Google, don't be mad at us)</li>
      <li>It allows universal access from every website via CORS</li>
      <li>It is Accessible</li>
      <li>It's Open Source, freely available on Github, and everybody can contribute to it.</li>
      <li>It uses the WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License, which is pretty clear on what you can and
        what you can't do
        <p class="fakepre">0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A little less contrast</h2>
    <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've
      even made this site's background a nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a
      lean 7 fucking lines.</p>
    <h2>Size Matters</h2>
    <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller
      type works well for print, not the screen.</p>
    <h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
    <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters
      long.
      Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
    <h3>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
    <p>I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm
      saying is
      that it's so, so simple to make sites
      easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're
      also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
